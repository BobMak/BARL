BARL: Base Agents for Reinforcement Learning

This codebase provides implementations of many RL algorithms with the goal of being flexible for new algorithm ideas and fast experimentation.

## TODO:
In the future we would like to have implemented:

### Algorithms:
- [ ] DQN
- [ ] SQL
- [ ] SAC
- [ ] Rainbow DQN
- [ ] TD3
- [ ] PPO

### Architectures:
- [ ] MLP
- [ ] CNN
- [ ] LSTM
- [ ] Dueling architectures
