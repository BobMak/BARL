BARL: Base Agents for Reinforcement Learning

This codebase provides implementations of many RL algorithms with the goal of being flexible for new algorithm ideas and fast experimentation.

## TODO:
In the future we would like to have implemented:
-[ ] DQN
-[ ] SQL
-[ ] SAC
-[ ] Rainbow DQN
-[ ] TD3
-[ ] PPO
